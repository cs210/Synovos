## **Overview**
Team Predictivity's goal was to empower building managers to perfectly understand how buildings are being used. We created a web application that lets building managers visualize past and predict future occupancy data for their buildings on a room-based level, using the input from various sensor types (Co2, humidity, occupancy, light, ...). 

We documented all our results here:
